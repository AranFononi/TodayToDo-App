# TodayToDo App 📝📱

### Building a Minimal Task Manager with SwiftUI & SwiftData

This app is a personal project I’ve been working on as part of my learning journey with SwiftUI and SwiftData. It’s a simple yet powerful **To-Do List app**, designed to help users keep track of their daily tasks. An iOS To-Do app built with SwiftUI, featuring a colorful, user-friendly interface that supports both light and dark modes. It allows users to easily manage tasks, mark them as completed, and customize settings for a personalized experience. This project uses SwiftData for efficient data management and showcases my practice with SwiftUI’s powerful layout and design capabilities. Future updates may include app store release—stay tuned!

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **TodayToDo** app allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. It uses **SwiftUI** for the user interface and **SwiftData** for storing tasks locally. This project helped me dive deeper into managing data in Swift apps and exploring more advanced SwiftUI features.
